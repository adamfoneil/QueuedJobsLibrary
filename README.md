This is a framework for working with `QueueTrigger` Azure Functions to enable app notifications and tracking of jobs.

- At the heart of this is an abstract class [JobRunner](https://github.com/adamfoneil/QueuedJobsLibrary/blob/master/QueuedJobs.Library/Abstract/JobRunner.cs) you'd use to implement the body of your Azure Function with a queue trigger. Here's a [sample](https://github.com/adamfoneil/QueuedJobsLibrary/blob/master/Testing/SampleJob.cs#L34) from the test project. As an abstract class, there a couple methods you need to implement: [OnExecuteAsync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/QueuedJobsLibrary/blob/master/QueuedJobs.Library/Abstract/JobRunner.cs#L31) and [OnStatusUpdate](https://github.com/adamfoneil/QueuedJobsLibrary/blob/master/QueuedJobs.Library/Abstract/JobRunner.cs#L36). The public method you call in your Azure Function is [ExecuteAsync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/QueuedJobsLibrary/blob/master/QueuedJobs.Library/Abstract/JobRunner.cs#L41)

- One of `JobRunner`'s dependencies is [IRepository](https://github.com/adamfoneil/QueuedJobsLibrary/blob/master/QueuedJobs.Library/Interfaces/IRepository.cs). This is what enables the `JobRunner` to get job info and update the status of jobs in a database or wherever you're tracking job info.

- The [QueuedJob](https://github.com/adamfoneil/QueuedJobsLibrary/blob/master/QueuedJobs.Library/Models/QueuedJob.cs) model class is intended to be created as a database table. This is where this [happens](https://github.com/adamfoneil/QueuedJobsLibrary/blob/master/Testing/SampleJob.cs#L87) in a test. This is abstract so you have to create your own table with a specific `TKey` type, as in this [example](https://github.com/adamfoneil/QueuedJobsLibrary/blob/master/Testing/SampleJob.cs#L62).

- There are a couple [extension method](https://github.com/adamfoneil/QueuedJobsLibrary/blob/master/QueuedJobs.Library/Extensions/QueueClientExtensions.cs), most importantly [QueueJobAsync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/QueuedJobsLibrary/blob/master/QueuedJobs.Library/Extensions/QueueClientExtensions.cs#L26) which you'd use from your client applications. This bundles the Azure Queue message send with storing the job info that is subsequently tracked.
